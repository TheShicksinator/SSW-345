# Reflection

Over the past few milestones, you've had the opportunity to apply several software engineering practices and processes in the design and implementation of a project.

### Design

1. What was most helpful about thinking about design and architecture of your project?
- Keeping up group meetings and constant communication to brainstorm and delegate tasks was really helpful in getting us to a productive workflow and design process. Having specific tasks allowed us each to hone a particular expertise while maintaining a sense of how everything interlocked in the final product.

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
- Learning to use the API we used to deal with coins, and learning to manage this periodic flow of data was the most difficult part. Some database refactoring to better accomodate data being stored over different intervals would help.

3. What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?
- Scrum and delegation of issues / the kanban board were really useful and I'll be sure to use them again.


### Testing

1. What was most helpful about implementing integration tests and mocking in your project?
- Since this was a discord bot, discord provided a way to really easily test the bot live, which allowed us to very easily track progress, especially when it was synchronized with a github web hook showing commits in the same thread.

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
- Making sure the commands we were testing were consistent and that the output was nicely formatted made testing a little vague at first, though this got better later on.

3. What testing methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?
- Having standard test cases for each use case would have streamlined the process more than what we did, and I'll definitely be doing that in future.


### Process

1. What was most helpful about implementing scrum-ban in your project?
- Easy to keep track of overall progress and who was doing what.

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
- Actually fully utilizing the features, github doesn't have the most intuitive way of handling scrum-ban, forgetting to close/assign issues was a common issue.

3. What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?
- Scrum-ban will definitely see use from be in the future. The simplicity of tracking everything in one table is very appealing to me.

### Overall

Considering all the design and architecture methods, testing practices, and software processes you've encountered---**compare and constrast** how the benefits of the different practices and how they might be useful together.

Waterfall Method -- Good for having a clear roadmap and managing resources/time, but bad when requirements can change late in the process, or when you catch a major organizational issue too late.

Spiral Method -- Great for changing requirements and a fast paced project, bad for time management and can snowball in complexity.

Scrum -- Great for getting everyone on the same page and having a clear roadmap, but it requires everyone to attend and can be very time consuming.

Stories -- Make functionality extremely clear by outlining the whole process, and makes task delegation easier.

Because of the dynamic nature of our project and the variability of our time, we found scrum and a spiral method the most effective for making our sprints efficient and delivering a good product in a timely manner, and with fairness to all involved.
